HORISEON HOMEWORK PROJECT
CSS + HTML Syntax/Sematic practice

~~~~~~~_____~~~~~~~_____~~~~~~~


This project was made for the purposes of understanding how to consolidate, use, and alter CSS and HTML as needed to improve clarity for myself and other coders. This will enable me to work with better practices in the future, which will further increase the efficiency and effectiveness of my learning. My work stands out because I'm amazing (very little, but with a project small and following specific guidelines, I have made a few little jokes; the more fun you make it, the better it works to teach and easier it is to keep going)
